## Overview

### The challenge

- To build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot
<!-- to be continued -->
![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- Background sgv for desktop not working with plain CSS but works with SCSS.

- I'm proud of using 
```css
overflow: hidden;
```
thanks Coder Coder

- Usage of flex justify-content and align-items

- Nesting using scss is a life-saver as I can easily manage the styles of a section

- I leveraged more the chrome developer tools by using increase and decrease of pixels, there's even a customization tool for colors that supports formats, hsla, rgba and #, which can be converted by just clicking a button. For the box-shadow style, hsl/hsla is not working so I used rgba just like coder coder's Easybank landing page.

- How to position the background image? Use background-position ;)

- I know Coder Coder used an Adobe software to measure the sizes of the images, but I just discovered that I can use MS Paint when I was close on finishing this challenge! But you know what they say, it's always never too late.
